ejs needs views to be opened

/:variable 

okay now the weird part
<%= %> runs javascript
<% %> this is for logic and anything else, wont show the stuff between. so if statements you dont want to see the actual statements.

passing as an object
app.get("/fallinlovewith/rusty/:thing", function(req, res){
    var thing = req.params.thing;
    res.render("love.ejs",{thingVar: thing}); //this
});

so what is this public directory?
It can be called whatever you want but it will serve as a location for stylesheets

what about the files in public? shouldnt we link to public/app.css not just app.css?
apparently express has a way to tell where it should look for all of it's stylesheets
